**Prompt:**  
Create a Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Accepts two command-line arguments:
   - `arg1`: The path to a PDF file.
   - `arg2`: The path to a directory where PNG files should be saved.

2. Defines a function called `convertPDF2PNG(pdf_path, output_dir)`, which:
   - Checks if the specified PDF file exists.
   - Validates that the file is a valid and readable PDF.
   - Ensures the specified output directory exists, creating it if necessary.
   - Converts each page of the PDF into a PNG file.
   - Saves each PNG file in the output directory with a filename format of:
     ```
     <original_pdf_filename>_page_<page_number>.png
     ```
   
3. Calls `convertPDF2PNG(arg1, arg2)` after parsing command-line arguments.

4. Implements proper error handling for:
   - Missing or incorrect command-line arguments.
   - Non-existent PDF files.
   - Invalid or unreadable PDFs.
   - Issues with writing PNG files to the directory.

5. Uses a suitable Python library (such as `pdf2image`) for PDF-to-PNG conversion.
